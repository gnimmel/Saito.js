THE GHOST IN THE CSH

SAITO.JS - A framework for WebGL by Section9

The idea of this was to play around with the LearningGL examples from the excellent site:  
http://learningwebgl.com. I figured it needed to be collected, expanded and turned into something
a little more similar to processing or openframeworks but with a twist. The idea is to create a 
simple framework in JS that allows easy visualisations within the browser.

This template makes use of the 960.css and JQuery/UI. The former is just for layout but the
internal scripts make heavy use of JQuery.

There are 4 functions you need to play with in the index.html file. These are preloop, update,
draw and loadresources and are fairly self explanatory.

Comments are always welcome and I'd love to get feedback.
